In an increasingly networked corporate world, the company-specific variables that are relevant from the perspective of crisis management are in very complex relationships and dynamic interactions with a wide range of external factors (e.g. location, customers, competition, suppliers, human resources market, legal and social framework). From these external interactions, far-reaching internal (domino) effects and interdependencies unfold across all areas of the company (operational, financial, strategic) (Fig. 1, right). Therefore, neither in-house expertise nor personal or local consultant knowledge is sufficient to generate valid, economically usable insights or to derive concrete crisis-related entrepreneurial measures.

The CoyPu project addresses the complex economic challenges in crisis situations with an intelligent platform for the integration, structuring, networking, analysis and evaluation of heterogeneous data from economic value networks as well as the industry environment and social context. Based on cognitive modeling of data within a funded system of networked knowledge graphs and flexibly configurable AI analysis tools, the CoyPu platform enables high-quality and up-to-date insights into economic facts, trends, causal relationships and forecasts. The crisis-relevant questions that can be answered in this way can relate to individual value-added networks or specific value-added chains, to different regions,
Due to its adaptability, the CoyPu platform can provide low-threshold self-service offers for broad use by SMEs, as well as complex analysis tools for economic ecosystems for professional use by analysts and facilitators, public administration institutions, politics and associations as well as research do. Extensively networked and semantically integrated data from a variety of sources form the basis of a new information transparency for companies and markets, especially in the SME sector. By providing user-friendly offers and enabling typical support roles for companies, SMEs can benefit from available AI functionalities even without access to technology specialists.

A federated approach at the level of data and methods as well as the inclusion of diverse legal issues throughout all development phases of the project is the basis of legally secure and data-sovereign applications in CoyPu. The intended broad use of the CoyPu solution, its announced alignment with open standards (e.g. W3C) and reference architectures (e.g. IDS) as well as the planned integration into large national initiatives (like the GAIA-X-Cloud) have lasting positive effects on stability and expected to be competitive in the German economy. By using the results provided by CoyPu, not only the ability to make decisions and adaptability in economic crises can be improved enormously in the future.
