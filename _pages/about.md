Hey, thanks for stopping by! ðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘‹

Currently, I'm a PhD student at the [SEMS Group](https://www.inf.uni-hamburg.de/en/inst/ab/sems/home.html) of University of Hamburg, under the supervision of [Prof. Dr. Ricardo Usbeck](https://www.inf.uni-hamburg.de/en/inst/ab/sems/people/ricardo-usbeck.html), working on problems at the intersection of AI x Language. My research interests are mainly in question answering systems, deep learning, federated learning, reinforcement learning and knowledge graphs.

In my spare time, I enjoy doing sports (mostly running, cycling, basketball and swimming), traveling with friends and family.
